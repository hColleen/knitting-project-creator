# Knitting/Crochet color repeat generator
Binary and Fibonacci numbers are visually pleasing and often used to create pseudo-random color repeats for craft projects.  The goal of this page is to create a program that will allow the user to select a number of colors (up to 10), a number of repeats (up to 20), and which number sequence to use to create a color patern.

The arrays are hardcoded to allow for limitations on how large a number of repeats can be created.
