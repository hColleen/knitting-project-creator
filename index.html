        <h2>Why these numbers?</h2>
        <p>Color changes based on either fibonacci numbers or binary numbers are visually pleasing, but what are they?
        </p>
        <p>Fibonacci numbers are found frequently in nature, aproximating the golden spiral when set in a tile pattern
            and often occuring elsewhere in nature (for example, pineapples often have 8 spirals in one direction and 13
            in another, both of which are Fibonacci numbers). The first 10 numbers of the sequence are 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8,
            13, 21, 34, 55. To get the numbers of the Fibonacci sequence, you take the two previous numbers and add them
            (0 is implied the first number, so 0+1=1, 1+1=2, 1+2=3 and so on). This pattern generator will limit the
            number of rows to the first 11 numbers of the Fibonacci sequence (up to 89).</p>
        <p>Binary based numbers are multiples of 2. While these numbers have become more important as the world becomes
            more digital, they are still visually pleasing as a geometric progression. The first 10 numbers in the binary
            progression are 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024. This pattern creator will limit the number of rows
            to the first seven numbers of the binary sequence (up to 128).</p>

        <p>Select the number of colors you'd like to work with then click Submit for the pattern to be generated. Each
            time you click "Submit", a new pattern will be generated.</p>
